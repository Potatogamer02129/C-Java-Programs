## **6. Extraction**

### **Principle**: 
Extraction separates components based on their differential solubility in two immiscible solvents. A solute will preferentially dissolve in one solvent over another.

- **Physical property**: Solubility.
- **Types of extraction**: Solid-liquid extraction, liquid-liquid extraction, and steam distillation.

### **Examples**:
- **Essential oil extraction**: Extracting essential oils like lavender using steam distillation.

### **General Principles of Separation Techniques**

1. **Filtration**: Separation based on particle size. A porous filter medium retains larger particles while allowing smaller particles (liquids or gases) to pass through.

2. **Distillation**: Separation based on differences in boiling points. The component with a lower boiling point evaporates first, then is condensed and collected.
